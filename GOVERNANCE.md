# Project Governance (Alpha)

## Goals
- Ensure open, neutral stewardship of the AINP protocol and reference implementation.
- Encourage broad participation from the agent ecosystem.

## Roles
- Maintainers: Review PRs, triage issues, cut releases.
- Contributors: Submit PRs, issues, docs, tests.
- Users: File feedback and feature requests.

## Decision Making
- Use the RFC process for protocol-level changes (extend `docs/rfcs`).
- For implementation changes, maintainers decide after open discussion.
- Seek rough consensus; document decisions in PRs and CHANGELOG.md.

## Adding Maintainers
- Nomination by an existing maintainer based on sustained contributions.
- Public announcement in the repo; one-week comment period.

## Code Ownership
- No single-entity ownership. The reference repo is community-governed.

## Conflict Resolution
- Attempt resolution in public forums (issues/PRs) with civility.
- Escalate to a maintainer vote if needed.
