# Submission Status Clarification

## What You're Seeing

The message you're seeing:
> "The last submission time for new Internet-Drafts before the meeting is 2026-03-02 23:59 UTC..."

**This is NOT a submission confirmation.** This is just an **informational notice** on the IETF submission page telling you about deadlines.

## How to Know If It Was Submitted

If your draft was **successfully submitted**, you would see:

1. **A confirmation page** with:
   - Draft name (e.g., `draft-nagulapalli-ainp-protocol-00`)
   - Status: "Active" or "Submitted"
   - Submission date
   - A success message

2. **In your Datatracker account:**
   - The draft would appear in "My Internet-Drafts"
   - Status would show as "Active" (not "Cancelled")

3. **You would receive:**
   - An email confirmation (if you have email notifications enabled)
   - A draft URL like: `https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-nagulapalli-ainp-protocol-00/`

## What You Actually Have

Based on your earlier message, your submission shows:
- **Status: Cancelled**
- **History shows:** "Submission rejected" with XML validation errors

This means:
- ❌ The draft was **NOT successfully submitted**
- ❌ It was **rejected** due to XML validation errors
- ✅ The submission was **cancelled** (you can try again)

## Current Situation

You're seeing the deadline message because:
- You're on the submission page
- IETF is showing you when submissions close before meetings
- This is just informational - you can still submit now

## Next Steps

1. **Fix the XML file** (the validation errors)
2. **Try submitting again**
3. **Look for a success confirmation** after upload
4. **Check your Datatracker** to see if the draft appears

The deadline message is just letting you know you have until March 2, 2026 to submit.
